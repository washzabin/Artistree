Artistree is a webapp which will help hire creative freelancers and also help freelancers choose projects to work on. There are many freelancing apps out there which are hubs for all sorts of professions, but this app targets only those who work in the creative field. Such professions include musicians, sound designers, writers, lyricists, costume designers, makeup artists, jewelry makers etc. An employer can post a project online and put out RFPs on the messageboard that will contain certain skill names in the form of tags and freelancers will be suggested those based on the skills they have selected for themselves when they created their profile on the website. Freelancers can even sign contracts with their employers and keep those records on the website. Employers can also pay their recruits through the portal on the website and the website will keep track of when the payment is due and how much needs to be paid on a periodic basis based on what was agreed upon in the contract.
